## Report
After examining the Women's Sexual Harassment (2001â€“2021) data set, we learned some important information on rape. Which are:
- While the number of stalking incidents is declining daily, one tendency is persistent: men who protest against stalking are more likely than women to be attacked by the stalkers.
- The rate of rape has dramatically increased recently compared to earlier years.
- Although there are more occurrences of attempted rape, the victims are less likely to file a lawsuit. Our society's way of thinking has a big impact on this.
- In the past, women were the major rape victims, but today, children are more frequently raped than women. However, women continue to be the primary victims of gang rape.
